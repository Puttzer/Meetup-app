			"details": "Ever since the first apes climbed out of the trees, there were apes who did it faster. Some apes just fell out of the tree. It's a sad fact that all apes are not created equal. Presenting our newest tree-climbing-down simulator, matchmaking. Play alone or with your friends against players of similar skill levels. Climb out of that tree at your own speed, confident that the apes around you arent beating you to the bananas. Which technically grow IN trees, but maybe the ripest ones probably fall to the ground? Yeah, that makes sense. Look, this isnt a banana simulator, people.",

			"details": "In the classic Smissmas story 'The Gift of the Magi', a girl sells all of her hair to a hair warehouse to buy her boyfriend a watch chain, but in a shocking twist, he looks at his watch and remembers she's bald and it's time to break up with her. That's when the Magi show up, and it is a BLOODBATH. The point is, giving people gifts can bite you in the ass. Too much potential for twist endings. So this Smissmas, why not sit back, scroll down, and leave the gift-giving to us.",
